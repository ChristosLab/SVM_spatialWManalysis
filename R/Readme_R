This folder contains the main functions needed to perform the Support Vector Machine classification, in the R environment. 
Input for these functions is contained in the output folder and consistes of a series of firing rates of various categories
of neurons (e.g. neurons with sustained activity during the delay period of the spatial working memory task). Firing rates
are collected from presentation of stimuli at different locations. SVM decodes location of stimulus held in spatial working memory.
